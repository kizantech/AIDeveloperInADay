# AI Developer In A Day

## ðŸš€ Build Production-Ready AI Applications in One Day

Welcome to **AI Developer in a Day** â€“ an intensive, hands-on workshop that transforms developers from AI beginners to confident AI application builders. In just one day, you'll build real, working AI applications using cutting-edge technology including **Azure AI Foundry** and **Semantic Kernel**.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you'll have created:

**An Intelligent Chat Application** - A fully functional AI assistant that can hold natural conversations

**Smart Plugin System** - AI that can call real APIs, check weather, and integrate with external tools!

**RAG-Powered Knowledge Assistant** - An AI that can answer questions about your documents and company data

**Multi-Agent Collaboration System** - Multiple AI agents working together to solve complex problems

## Who This Workshop Is For

- **Developers** with little to no AI experience who want to build real applications
- **Technical professionals** ready to integrate AI into their existing projects  
- **Teams** looking to quickly upskill on modern AI development practices

## Learning Approach

This is a **practical, build-first workshop**. Every concept is taught through hands-on coding challenges where you'll immediately apply what you learn. We recommend working in **teams of 3-5 people** to encourage collaboration and peer learning.

**Time Investment**: Each core challenge takes 30-60 minutes  
**Technology Stack**: Python, Azure AI Foundry, Semantic Kernel 

## Learning Objectives

### Core AI Development Skills
- **Semantic Kernel Fundamentals** - Build AI applications with enterprise-grade frameworks
- **Plugin Architecture** - Create modular, reusable AI capabilities
- **Function Calling** - Enable AI to interact with external systems and APIs
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** - Ground AI responses in your own data
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Coordinate multiple AI agents for complex workflows

### Azure AI Platform
- **Azure AI Foundry** - Deploy and manage AI models at scale
- **AI Search Integration** - Build intelligent search and knowledge retrieval
- **Model Deployment** - Host and serve AI models in production

### Production Considerations
- **AI Safety & Responsible AI** - Build ethical and reliable AI systems
- **Error Handling** - Create robust AI applications that gracefully handle edge cases
- **Performance Optimization** - Efficiently use AI resources and manage costs
